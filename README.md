###  Biography

I received the **B.S. degree** in mechanical engineering and automation from **Hohai University** in 2015, and the **Ph.D. degree** in control science and engineering from [**RaHAIC**](https://rh.nankai.edu.cn/) (Robot Autonomy and Human-AI Collaboration), the Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information System, **Nankai University** in 2020, supervised by [**Prof. Xuebo Zhang**](https://ai.nankai.edu.cn/info/1033/3984.htm). My research interest includes **localization** and **mapping** for **mobile robots**.

From July 2020 to July 2021, I worked as a **Senior Algorithm Engineer** in **IAS BU** (Huawei Intelligent Automotive Solution), with research interests including **freespace extraction**, **APA** (Auto Parking Assist), and **AVP** (Automated Valet Parking). From July 2021 to February 2025, I was a research scientist (Associate Professor) at Zhejiang Lab. Currently, I am a Principal Investigator at the Hangzhou Global Innovation and Technology Center of Zhejiang University (ZJU-HIC). My research interests include **localization** and **perception** for **intelligent vehicles** and **mobile robots**.
